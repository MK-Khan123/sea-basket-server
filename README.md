# Sea Basket (task for Proffus Limited)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `Firebase Live Site Link`

The project was deployed at Firebase. One can access the link by clicking here [Firebase Live Site Link](https://sea-basket-1811e.web.app/).

### `Technology Used`
* React.js
* Material UI
* React Router
* MongoDB
* Firebase Authentication
* Context API
* Node.js
* Express.js
* React Hooks Form
* Axios
* CRUD operations
* Heroku
* SweetAlert2

### `Project Features`

1. Applied Private Route (also known as Protected Route/ Authenticated Route) to restrict convenient access while clicking on Admin. Implemented one click sign in using Firebase Authentication. 

2. Used Context API for state management.

3. The data displayed in the homepage is fetched from MongoDB. I barely used static data in this project.

4. Exhausted CRUD operations on multiple occasions while building the website.

5. In addition, I used Material UI to make the website device responsive. Furthermore, I deployed the client side on Firebase which can be accessed through the above mentioned link. Server side is deployed using Heroku.
